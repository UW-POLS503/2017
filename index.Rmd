Instructions for Jeff's office hours:

1. Sign up for a 30-minute slot using the Google Calendar appointments link emailed to the class.

2. Email me 24 hours prior to your appointment with what you would like to discuss.

These instructions will ensure that our time is efficiently spent and I can be of the most help to you.

#### Communication

In this course we will be using [Slack](https://slack.com/) for online class discussion. You will not be required to post, but the system is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently from classmates, and the instructors.
Rather than emailing questions to the instructors, post your questions to [https://uwpolsmethods.slack.com/](Slack).
You should have received an invitation to join this team, if not contact us to receive an invite.

I expect that students will already be familiar with **R**, so class time will not be spent introducing it.
This is so that 

Though not necessary, you are encouraged to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) Desktop integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
